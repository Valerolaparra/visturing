# Visturing: A Turing Test for Artificial Nets devoted to Vision
This repository contains the source code, datasets, and experiments associated with the research paper "A Turing Test for Artificial Nets devoted to Vision", published in Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence (2025).

The project implements a comprehensive evaluation framework (a visual "Turing Test") to assess whether Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibit the same low-level spatio-chromatic properties as the human Retina-V1 pathway.

## Overview

Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision, but do they actually "see" like humans? This work proposes that for an ANN to be considered a valid biological model, it must pass rigorous psychophysical and physiological tests, not just achieve high accuracy on segmentation or classification tasks.

Key Contributions:

The Test Suite: A collection of 10 qualitative and quantitative tests covering fundamental properties of the visual system (e.g., contrast sensitivity, masking, frequency tuning).

Model Comparison: We evaluate three distinct modeling approaches:

Parametric Model: Optimized via Maximum Differentiation (MaxDiff).

Non-Parametric Model (PerceptNet): Optimized to maximize correlation with human subjective distortion.

Segmentation Model: The same architecture as PerceptNet, but trained for a technical segmentation task.

Results: The code reproduces the paper's findings, showing that models trained on human perception (PerceptNet) align significantly better with biological behavior than those trained for pure computer vision tasks.

## Installation

To reproduce the experiments, clone this repository and install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment (Anaconda or venv).

```Bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Jorgvt/visturing.git
cd visturing

# Create a virtual environment (optional)
conda create -n visturing python=3.9
conda activate visturing

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage & Reproduction
The primary results and figures from the paper are generated using Jupyter Notebooks.

To evaluate some models check the folder *use_examples*
